- Standardaize Node model so it doesnt only work for Trees

- Refactor Blackboard to be more then just a hashmap. Will make later changes easier
	✓ Move to own struct
	- Path based black board (global and personal namespace)
		- /world/time			#The current time of the world
		- ~/counter 			#Some personal counter
		- /entities/some_name	#An other entities personal namespace

- Tree
	- State based chooser (Selects one of its child nodes based on which state the owner is in)

- State Machine
	- Change state based on received signals
	- How often can state change in a single tick?
		- Buffer state changes or apply them in real time (or both)
	- State should be available in blackboard but prob not be managed there (special name space for states?)
	- Allow Nested State Machines

- Subsumption Architecture

- Was auch immer Left4Dead für dialog da gemacht hat

- Utility Maximizer

- Utility functions
	- A* and NavMesh (somehow acces built in Godot Versions)
	- Utility Point cloud 
		- calc_pointcloud(function, center, range) -> Pointcloud #Return a pointcloud that can bes processed further
		- find_best(function, center, range, n) -> Vec(Position) #Return a Vec with the n highest utility points in the cloud
